1. Play interactive manual games.

2. Run automated simulations.

3. Track wins, losses, and draws.

4. Visualize game statistics with real-time graphs.

🔥 Features

✅ Interactive game mode with user inputs

✅ Graphical analysis of win/loss trends

✅ Tracks player and dealer moves over multiple rounds


🚀 Getting Started

1️⃣ Installation

Make sure you have Python installed. Then install dependencies:
